You finished all the work on your docket. Congrats! You did a thing. Go you. What now?

Follow these in order:

- Are there any **Blocker** issues at the top of the backlog?
   - take them ASAP
- Do any of your open PRs have reviews that require addressing?
   - respond to the comments/make the changes
- Do any of your open PRs need reviews/testing?
   - let the team know, or ask someone specific
- Are there any open PRs that need reviews/testing?
   - review/test whatever you can
- Is there anything at the top of the backlog you know how to do?
   - anything unclaimed is up for grabs. you can skip issues, but try to stick to the prioritized order
- Ask someone.
   - usually Dobry or Frank.

You are responsible for your own time management. No one else is going to be on your ass about what you're doing, but try not to be sneaky about slacking off. Doing non-work things is cool as long as you don't hide it.
