**Scenario:** You want to create a new item of work

- Search for related issues
- *If no issue exists yet:*
   - Create a [new issue](../format/Issue.md)

   > Issue transitions to **Open**

- Ops/Architecture approves issue for work - issue gains "Spec'd" tag. Any issue without a spec'd tag is
    simply an idea that needs discussing.

- When Ops/Architecture deem that it is a good time for work to start for a certain issue, the issue
    will then get placed onto the board, in the "To Do" column.
